    		The word 'Pol' is derived from a Sanskrit word 'Pratoli' . The 'Pols' were known as 'Pada' in the Solanki period. It is said that when Sultan Ahmed Shah found the city, he stayed in the pol in the beginning.This pol was known as 'Mahurat Pol', which is now in Manekchowk.

These pols are the real indentity of Ahmedabad. Without proper knowledge of the pols, our knowledge of Ahmedabad is incomplete. In the old documents, names of Dhinkawa Chowky, Haja Patel's Pol, Nisha Pol, Bhanderi Pol etc. are mentioned. The construction of new pols continued and even increased during - Maratha Rule. Many pols were constructed during the years 1760 to 1818. The number of pols constructed during this time was 360. The city has many big and small pols ranging from six house pol (Ghar-ni-Pol) to pols having about 3,000 houses (a big settlement). The biggest pol of Ahmedabad is known as Mandavi-ni-pol. At present, there are about 60,000 houses in 600 pols of Ahmedabad.
